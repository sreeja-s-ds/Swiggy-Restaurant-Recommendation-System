**🍽️ Swiggy Restaurant Recommendation System using Streamlit**

This project is a restaurant recommendation engine designed using a real-world Swiggy dataset. It enables users to receive restaurant suggestions  based on their preferences such as city, rating, cuisine, and cost. 
               
Built using Python and Streamlit, the application demonstrates the full data science pipeline from cleaning to deployment. 

**🚀 Project Overview**

**Objective**

To develop a recommendation system that suggests restaurants to users based on city, rating, cost, and cuisine preferences using clustering techniques.

**Domain**

Recommendation Systems, Data Analytics

**Approach**

1. **Data Cleaning**

Removed duplicates and handled missing values

Created cleaned_data.csv

2.**Preprocessing**

Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical columns

Saved as encoded_data.csv

Serialized encoder as encoder.pkl

3.**Recommendation Engine**

Used K-Means Clustering / Cosine Similarity on the encoded dataset

Mapped recommendations back to original data

4. **Streamlit Interface**

User inputs preferences

Recommendations are displayed with restaurant details

**🖥️ Streamlit App Features**

🎯 User selects preferences like city, cuisine, rating, and price

🤖 Backend engine uses clustering or similarity to compute matches

📋 Clean and interactive results from the cleaned dataset are displayed

🧪 Personalized Recommendations for better user experience

🧪 Customer Behavior Analysis for targeted marketing
